# switch-recording-assistant

A simple tool, created to make it easy to record long game clips on Nintendo Switch.


---

## What's the concept behind this app?
Not everyone has a capture card to record gameplays on a console like the Nintendo Switch. The Switch in particular, has a built-in screen recorder (that also records game audio), but has a major limitation: you can only record 30 seconds of gameplay. Specifically, the last 30 seconds of gameplay. This app aims to fix this issue and lets you record long gameplays.

## So, how does this work in practise?
On a Switch you can record the last 30 seconds of gameplay while playing just by long-pressing the capture button (the little rectangular one with a circle in it). Pressing the record button every 30 seconds or less, you can technically record an entire gameplay. Yes, you would have a lot of split-up video clips, but you would only have to join them all together in a single long video file, and then you would have a perfect long gameplay in your hands.

## Then, why the need for an app like this?
While playing a game, you usually focus on playing that game, and not on counting time in your head or watching a stopwatch go by its way. With this app, you only either need to keep a slight eye on your phone's screen for color flashes (even with just peripheral vision), feel for vibrations or even audio cues. Then, when feeling your chosen trigger, long-press the capture button and your done. This is a good way to keep the maximum focus possible on your gameplay.

## Features of this app
* Enable **audio cues or vibration**, or just keep them disabled
