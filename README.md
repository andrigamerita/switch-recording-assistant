# switch-recording-assistant

A simple tool, created to make it easy to record long game clips on Nintendo Switch.

### What's the concept behind this app?
Not everyone has a capture card to record gameplays on a console like the Nintendo Switch. The Switch in particular, has a built-in screen recorder (that also records game audio), but has a major limitation: you can only record 30 seconds of gameplay. Specifically, the last 30 seconds of gameplay. This app aims to fix this issue and lets you record long gameplays.

### So, how does this work in practise?
On a Switch you can record the last 30 seconds of gameplay while playing just by long-pressing the capture button (the little rectangular one with a circle in it). Pressing the record button every 30 seconds or less, you can technically record an entire gameplay. Yes, you would have a lot of split-up video clips, but you would only have to join them all together in a single long video file, and then you would have a perfect long gameplay in your hands.

### Then, why the need for an app like this?
While playing a game, you usually focus on playing that game, and not on counting time in your head or watching a stopwatch go by its way. With this app, you only either need to keep a slight eye on your phone's screen for color flashes (even with just peripheral vision), feel for vibrations or even audio cues. Then, when feeling your chosen trigger, long-press the capture button and your done. This is a good way to keep the maximum focus possible on your gameplay.

## How to use the app?
It's simple. Boot up the game on your Switch, then tweak the settings of the app as you wish, like which triggers to use and how often the app should call them. After a certain amount of time that you have decided, the app will let you know in a smart way that you need to press the Capture Button on your Switch controller to save a game clip. The app will continue to send you triggers until you stop or pause it. 
When you have finished recording what you wanted to, stop the app and transfer the clips from your Switch to your device (phone, PC, ecc..) and just join them together! You now  have a normal, long recorded gameplay.

### Features of the app
